+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+

+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.

+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."

+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.

+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;

+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,

+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;

+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.

+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,

+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.

+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.

+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,

+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;

+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind

+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.

+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.

+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."

+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.

+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;

+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,

+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;

+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.

+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,

+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.

+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.

+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,

+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
+Hasten more that thou art needed,
+Haste and help this helpless maiden!"
+
+When she ceased her supplications,
+Scarce a moment onward passes,
+Ere a beauteous duck descending,
+Hastens toward the water-mother,
+Comes a-flying hither, thither,
+Seeks herself a place for nesting.
+Flies she eastward, flies she westward,
+Circles northward, circles southward,
+Cannot find a grassy hillock,
+Not the smallest bit of verdure;
+Cannot find a spot protected,
+Cannot find a place befitting,
+Where to make her nest in safety.
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+She descries no place for resting,
+Thinking loud and long debating,
+And her words are such as follow:
+"Build I in the winds my dwelling,
+On the floods my place of nesting?
+Surely would the winds destroy it,
+Far away the waves would wash it."
+
+Then the daughter of the Ether,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Raised her shoulders out of water,
+Raised her knees above the ocean,
+That the duck might build her dwelling,
+Build her nesting-place in safety.
+Thereupon the duck in beauty,
+Flying slowly, looking round her,
+Spies the shoulders of the maiden,
+Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,
+Now the hapless water-mother,
+Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,
+On the blue back of the ocean.
+Thence she flies and hovers slowly,
+Lightly on the knee she settles,
+Finds a nesting-place befitting,
+Where to lay her eggs in safety.
+Here she builds her humble dwelling,
+Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,
+Six, the golden eggs she lays there,
+Then a seventh, an egg of iron;
+Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,
+Quickly warms them on the knee-cap
+Of the hapless water-mother;
+Hatches one day, then a second,
+Then a third day sits and hatches.
+Warmer grows the water round her,
+Warmer is her bed in ocean,
+While her knee with fire is kindled,
+And her shoulders too are burning,
+Fire in every vein is coursing.
+Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,
+Shakes her members in succession,
+Shakes the nest from its foundation,
+And the eggs fall into ocean,
+Dash in pieces on the bottom
+Of the deep and boundless waters.
+In the sand they do not perish,
+Not the pieces in the ocean;
+But transformed, in wondrous beauty
+All the fragments come together
+Forming pieces two in number,
+One the upper, one the lower,
+Equal to the one, the other.
+From one half the egg, the lower,
+Grows the nether vault of Terra:
+From the upper half remaining,
+Grows the upper vault of Heaven;
+From the white part come the moonbeams,
+From the yellow part the sunshine,
+From the motley part the starlight,
+From the dark part grows the cloudage;
+And the days speed onward swiftly,
+Quickly do the years fly over,
+From the shining of the new sun
+From the lighting of the full moon.
+
+Still the daughter of the Ether,
+Swims the sea as water-mother,
+With the floods outstretched before her,
+And behind her sky and ocean.
+Finally about the ninth year,
+In the summer of the tenth year,
+Lifts her head above the surface,
+Lifts her forehead from the waters,
+And begins at last her workings,
+Now commences her creations,
+On the azure water-ridges,
+On the mighty waste before her.
+Where her hand she turned in water,
+There arose a fertile hillock;
+Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,
+There she made a hole for fishes;
+Where she dived beneath the waters,
+Fell the many deeps of ocean;
+Where upon her side she turned her,
+There the level banks have risen;
+Where her head was pointed landward,
+There appeared wide bays and inlets;
+When from shore she swam a distance,
+And upon her back she rested,
+There the rocks she made and fashioned,
+And the hidden reefs created,
+Where the ships are wrecked so often,
+Where so many lives have perished.
+
+Thus created were the islands,
+Rocks were fastened in the ocean,
+Pillars of the sky were planted,
+Fields and forests were created,
+Checkered stones of many colors,
+Gleaming in the silver sunlight,
+All the rocks stood well established;
+But the singer, Wainamoinen,
+Had not yet beheld the sunshine,
+Had not seen the golden moonlight,
+Still remaining undelivered.
+Wainamoinen, old and trusty,
+Lingering within his dungeon
+Thirty summers altogether,
+And of winters, also thirty,
+Peaceful on the waste of waters,
+On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,
+Well reflected, long considered,
+How unborn to live and flourish
+In the spaces wrapped in darkness,
+In uncomfortable limits,
+Where he had not seen the moonlight,
+Had not seen the silver sunshine.
+Thereupon these words be uttered,
+Let himself be heard in this wise:
+"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,
+Take me, thou, O Sun above me,
+Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,
+From this dark and dreary prison,
+From these unbefitting portals,
+From this narrow place of resting,
+From this dark and gloomy dwelling,
+Hence to wander from the ocean,
+Hence to walk upon the islands,
+On the dry land walk and wander,
+Like an ancient hero wander,
+Walk in open air and breathe it,
+Thus to see the moon at evening,
+Thus to see the silver sunlight,
+Thus to see the Bear in heaven,
+That the stars I may consider."
+
+Since the Moon refused to free him,
+And the Sun would not deliver,
+Nor the Great Bear give assistance,
+His existence growing weary,
+And his life but an annoyance,
+Bursts he then the outer portals
+Of his dark and dismal fortress;
+With his strong, but unnamed finger,
+Opens he the lock resisting;
+With the toes upon his left foot,
+With the fingers of his right hand,
+Creeps he through the yielding portals
+To the threshold of his dwelling;
+On his knees across the threshold,
+Throws himself head foremost, forward
+Plunges into deeps of ocean,
+Plunges hither, plunges thither,
+Turning with his hands the water;
+Swims he northward, swims he southward,
+Swims he eastward, swims he westward,
+Studying his new surroundings.
+
+Thus our hero reached the water,
+Rested five years in the ocean,
+Six long years, and even seven years,
+Till the autumn of the eighth year,
+When at last he leaves the waters,
+Stops upon a promontory,
+On a coast bereft of verdure;
+On his knees he leaves the ocean,
+On the land he plants his right foot,
+On the solid ground his left foot,
+Quickly turns his hands about him,
+Stands erect to see the sunshine,
+Stands to see the golden moonlight,
+That he may behold the Great Bear,
+That he may the stars consider.
+Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,
+Thus the wonderful enchanter
+Was delivered from his mother,
+Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.
+
+IN primeval times, a maiden,
+Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,
+Passed for ages her existence
+In the great expanse of heaven,
+O'er the prairies yet enfolded.
+Wearisome the maiden growing,
+Her existence sad and hopeless,
+Thus alone to live for ages
+In the infinite expanses
+Of the air above the sea-foam,
+In the far outstretching spaces,
+In a solitude of ether,
+She descended to the ocean,
+Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.
+Thereupon the rising storm-wind
+Flying from the East in fierceness,
+Whips the ocean into surges,
+Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean
+Till the waves are white with fervor.
+To and fro they toss the maiden,
+Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;
+With her sport the rolling billows,
+With her play the storm-wind forces,
+On the blue back of the waters;
+On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,
+Play the forces of the salt-sea,
+With the lone and helpless maiden;
+Till at last in full conception,
+Union now of force and beauty,
+Sink the storm-winds into slumber;
+Overburdened now the maiden
+Cannot rise above the surface;
+Seven hundred years she wandered,
+Ages nine of man's existence,
+Swam the ocean hither, thither,
+Could not rise above the waters,
+Conscious only of her travail;
+Seven hundred years she labored
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+Thus she swam as water-mother,
+Toward the east, and also southward,
+Toward the west, and also northward;
+Swam the sea in all directions,
+Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,
+Swam in travail, swam unceasing,
+Ere her first-born was delivered.
+
+Then began she gently weeping,
+Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:
+"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
+Woe is me, in this my travail!
+Into what have I now fallen?
+Woe is me, that I unhappy,
+Left my home in subtle ether,
+Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,
+To be tossed by rolling billows,
+To be rocked by winds and waters,
+On the far outstretching waters,
+In the salt-sea's vast expanses,
+Knowing only pain and trouble!
+Better far for me, O Ukko!
+Were I maiden in the Ether,
+Than within these ocean-spaces,
+To become a water-mother!
+All this life is cold and dreary,
+Painful here is every motion,
+As I linger in the waters,
+As I wander through the ocean.
+Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,
+Thou the ruler of the heavens,
+Come thou hither, thou art needed,
+Come thou hither, I implore thee,
+To deliver me from trouble,
+To deliver me in travail.
+Come I pray thee, hither hasten,
